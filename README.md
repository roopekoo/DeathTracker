# DeathTracker
This Minecraft plugin tracks players' deaths and playtime. DeathTracker calculates death time (death density) and gives the top 10 statistics of these values.
Deathtracker works at least for Minecraft 1.17.1 (should work for earlier versions too, not tested) and with Spigotmc or Papermc.
